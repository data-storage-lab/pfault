This repository contains the source code for "PFault: A General Framework for Analyzing the 
Reliability of High-Performance Parallel File Systems", which is published in the 
32nd ACM/SIGARCH International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS'18, http://ics2018.ict.ac.cn/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The description of each component is as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual Device Manager:
  - Source code in "pf_virtual_device_manager" folder
  - Manages the persistent state of the target Parallel File System (PFS)

Failure State Emulator:
  - Source code in "pf_failure_state_emulator" folder
  - Injects faults based on the following fault models (Please refer to the paper 
    for their description):
        - Whole Device Failure
        - Network Partitioning
        - Global Inconsistency

Workload Generator and Checker:
  - Source code in "pf_pfs_worker" and "pf_pfs_checker" folders
  - Generates I/O operations and checks correctness of the recovery

For more information you could refer to our research paper 
at http://ics2018.ict.ac.cn/essay/ics18-cameraready-submitted.pdf

Steps to initiate the tool:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.  (Optional) Required to be able to run sudo commands

  2.  Make tgtd first:
 
      cd /path/to/pfault/pf_virtual_device_manager/iscsi
      make

  3.  Set password-less ssh for all the servers and clients
  
  4.  Copy configuration template:

      cd /path/to/pfault/configuration
      cp configuration_template.sh configuration.sh

      Fill the configuration.sh with the required Lustre setup

  5.  Run "Virtual Device Manager" to build the Lustre Cluster 

      cd /path/to/pfault/pf_virtual_device_manager/
      ./vdm.sh

  6.  Run any workloads on the cluster. For example, there are few workloads in the folder:
      /path/to/pfault/workload_example
  
  7.  The user may select the various failure models in "Failure State Emulator"
